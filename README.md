🎉 React Testimonials Carousel
This React application displays a testimonials carousel featuring quotes from various users. Users can navigate through the testimonials using the left and right arrow buttons or opt for a surprise quote by clicking the "Surprise me" button.

📦 Tech Stack:
* React
* React Icons (for arrow and quote icons)

👩🏽‍🍳 Features:
* Displays testimonials with user images, names, job titles, and quotes.
* Allows users to navigate through testimonials using left and right arrow buttons.
* Provides a "Surprise me" button to display a random testimonial.

💭 Process:
 The project began with setting up a React environment and fetching data. I designed components to showcase * * * testimonials and implemented navigation functionality using React state. Challenges included ensuring smooth transitions between testimonials and preventing repetitive quotes when generating random testimonials. Through trial and error, I refined the navigation logic and implemented a random quote generator. The project provided valuable experience in managing state in React and handling user interactions.

📚 Learnings:
* Enhanced understanding of React hooks, particularly useState and useEffect.
* Practiced handling user events and state changes in React applications.
* Gained experience in implementing carousel-like functionality for displaying dynamic content.

✨ Improvement:
* Implement transition animations for smoother testimonial transitions.
